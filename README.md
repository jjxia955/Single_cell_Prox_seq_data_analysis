# Single_cell_Prox_seq_data_analysis
This a python-based computational pipeline including package scanpy, scvi, celltypist and Prox-seq custom script ProxseqClasses.

This repo will cover basic single cell analysis procedures including quality control, PCA, clustering, cell type annotation, and visiulization. Specifically, intergrated analysis of sc-RNA and sc-Proxseq data will be shown. Spatial data analysis which might cover PLA visiulization, cell type deconvolution, and cell-cell interaction will be presented further. 

# Details of ProxseqClasses.py

# Data availability 
The tutorial is based on pbmc dataset from 10x pipeline. PLA dataset is uploaded and RNA data can be found in NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus under accession numbers GSE149574.
