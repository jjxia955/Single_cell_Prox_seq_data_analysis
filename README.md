# Single_cell_Prox_seq_data_analysis
This a python-based computational pipeline including package scanpy, scvi, and Prox-seq custom script ProxseqClasses.

This repo will cover basic single cell analysis procedures including quality control, PCA, clustering, and visiulization. Specifically, intergrated analysis of sc-RNA and sc-Proxseq data will be shown. Spatial data analysis which might cover PLA visiulization, cell type deconvolution, and cell-cell interaction will be presented further.
